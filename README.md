# Time Series Imputation

Time series is an ordered sequence of data points spread over a constant temporal intervals - e.g., daily, monthly, or yearly. Missing values in time series is a huge problem limiting the application of a range of algorithms that can't handle NaN values.

The aim of this project is to analyse the state of art and propose a new model imputing missing values in the case of time series.
